# Water Potability Prediction using Machine Learning

Water potability refers to the suitability of water for drinking purposes. In this project, we will analyze a dataset containing several key water quality features such as pH, hardness, solids, and chloramines to predict whether the water is potable or not. 

We will perform data exploration, preprocessing, and apply machine learning algorithms to build a model that can predict water potability. Our goal is to identify which features play the most important role in determining potability and develop an accurate prediction model.
